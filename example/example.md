> “When I write, I feel like an armless, legless man with a crayon in his mouth.” — Kurt Vonnegut

If you're starting to program, you might feel like Kurt. It's hard to wrap your head around a complex new world filled with intricacies, best practices, and alien-looking examples.

As a self-taught developer who's worked in the industry for several years, these are some of the things I wish someone had told me when I was just starting out. None of them are specific to a single language – they're more about the general mindset of learning to code.


## About being on fire (and recursion)

For how many times my teachers told me to "stop, drop, and roll" as a kid, I thought I'd be on fire more times in my life.

It's the same thing with programming terms like _recursion_ — I thought it was going to be much more common than it is in practice.

If you're _just_ starting out, learn the very basics: variables, comments, functions, and so on. Tackle the harder concepts once you have a need for them. It's much easier to learn something when you understand _why_ you need to use it.


## Lean into motivation

After you learn the basics, try to build something you're curious about. For me, this was a WordPress plugin and a Zelda-like dungeon generator. You'll learn faster and stay more motivated when you're interested in the finished product.
